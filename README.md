  ## Description
  -My motivation for the project was to create a application where you view and save employees, roles and department information.
  -The reasoning behind the project was to make it easier to keep track of important information for employers.
  -The problem that is solved is having an easy way to keep track of important information without having to look through a whole lot of applications to find it.
  -I learned how to create new functions using SQL and linking information to a server.
